### I am a sophmore Computer Science major and am part of the Albert Dorman Honors College at NJIT. 
### I love coding and solving puzzles and am excited to begin taking more major-related coursework including this class! I have been taking coding classes since high school (c++, java, webpage design) and have used Github repositories to create a digital portfolio and share my coursework. This is my first time using Git and Github to create an appliation project from scratch and I am looking forward to learning about this style of programming!
